Assumption:
1- Menu is not created by the user, it is created by the system manager hence the input validation for setting the 
menu members is not needed.

2- A menu should have at least one item (in the constructor). If any additional items were needed, then the add new item
method should be used.









--Data Structure usage for the menu:
The data structure used was the ArrayList because it can handle the menu items and it is easy to manipulate 
(add/modify/delete)
